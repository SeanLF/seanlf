# Sean Floyd

**Senior Backend Engineer | Reliable Systems at Scale**

9 years of Rails. Now building production AI systems end-to-end - Python, Rust, Ruby, and the infrastructure around them. M.Sc. in ML/distributed systems.

At Hivebrite I cut €160k/year in infrastructure costs, took data exports from days to minutes, and halved build times - while the team grew from 9 to 40 engineers. I care about owning systems, not just passing through them.

Grew up across 6 countries (diplomatic family). 4+ years remote across 5 continents, comfortable async.

Actively looking for full-time or contract roles. [seanfloyd.dev](https://seanfloyd.dev) has the full story.

## Proof of Work

**[claude-rss-news-digest](https://github.com/SeanLF/claude-rss-news-digest)** - Production publishing system built end-to-end: Python pipeline for RSS ingestion, Claude curation via MCP with schema-validated output, Rust web server, Terraform-managed deploys. Runs unattended every morning. [Wrote about making it reliable.](https://seanfloyd.dev/blog/i-stopped-hoping-my-llm-would-cooperate)

**[Rails Core Contribution](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/46586)** - Found a production bottleneck, fixed it upstream. 20x-670x speedup in ActiveSupport.

**[Jazzify](https://web.archive.org/web/20241212002426/https://jazzify.ca/)** - Volunteer platform for Ottawa Jazz Festival. Built and ran it for 9 years. Production Rails, real users, real ops.

**[still_active](https://github.com/SeanLF/still_active)** - RubyGem to check if your dependencies are still maintained. Scratched my own itch.
