# Sean Floyd

**Senior Backend Engineer | Rails Performance & Cost Optimization**

Grew up across 6 countries before high school (diplomatic family). Turns out being the perpetual new kid prepares you well for remote work. 4+ years remote across 5 continents, comfortable async.

9 years of Rails. I help SaaS companies stop burning money on infrastructure. At Hivebrite, I cut €160k/year in costs, reduced data exports from days to minutes, and halved build times while the team grew from 9 to 40 engineers.

Open to full-time or contract. [seanfloyd.dev](https://seanfloyd.dev) has the full story.

**[still_active](https://github.com/SeanLF/still_active)** - RubyGem to check if your dependencies are still maintained. Scratched my own itch.
